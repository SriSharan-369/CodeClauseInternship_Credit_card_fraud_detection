# CodeClauseInternship_Credit_card_fraud_detection

The project revolves around the development of an effective credit card fraud detection system using the Logistic Regression model. Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to financial institutions and users alike, necessitating advanced techniques for early detection and prevention.

Employing a comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions, we will leverage Logistic Regression's ability to model binary outcomes. By analyzing transaction features, such as transaction amount, location, time, and user behavior patterns, our model will learn to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent activities.

The Logistic Regression model's probabilistic nature will allow us to calculate the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent. We will set a suitable threshold to classify transactions as genuine or fraudulent, aiming to strike a balance between precision and recall.

Our project will encompass data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and performance evaluation. We will utilize metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.

Through this project, we aspire to create a robust credit card fraud detection solution that assists financial institutions in safeguarding their clients' assets. By harnessing the power of Logistic Regression, we aim to provide a reliable tool for minimizing financial losses due to fraudulent activities and enhancing overall transaction security.
